//! A factory method returning execution strategies
//!
//! ## About
//!
//! The factory functions defined in this file is one of the few functions
//! exported from the ExecutionEngine library, and takes an enumeration value
//! detailing which execution strategy should be used.  In the case of
//! `Interpretation` being chosen, an implementation of the `ExecutionEngine` trait
//! is returned which uses an interpretation execution strategy.  Similarly, in
//! the case of `JIT` an implementation using a JITting execution strategy is
//! returned.  Note that the `ExecutionEngine` trait is essentially this library's
//! interface to the outside world, and details exactly what external clients
//! such as `freestanding-executuon-engine` and `mexico-city` can rely on.
//!
//! ## Todo
//!
//! Try to merge `single_threaded_execution_engine` and
//! `multi_threaded_execution_engine` into a single function.  Problem: if you
//! return `boxed::Box<..>` then `mexico-city/src/managers/mod.rs` is seemingly
//! impossible to implement as you run into issues with no compile-time size for
//! the trait object when converting the `Box<..>` into `Arc<Mutex<..>>`.
//!
//! Also: remove the panic and include a proper error report that is propagated.
