//! Common code for implementing Veracruz host-calls
//!
//! ## About
//!
//! The Veracruz H-call interface consists of the following functions:
//! - `__veracruz_hcall_input_count()` which returns the count of secret
//!   data sources available to the program,
//! - `__veracruz_hcall_read_input()` which fills a WASM buffer with a
//!   particular input,
//! - `__veracruz_hcall_input_size()` which returns the size, in bytes, of a
//!   particular input,
//! - `__veracruz_hcall_write_output()` which can be used by the WASM
//!   program to register its result by pointing the host to a WASM buffer
//!   which is then copied into the host,
//! - `__veracruz_hcall_getrandom()` which fills a WASM buffer with random
//!   bytes taken from a platform-specific entropy source.
//!
//! The implementation of some of these functions relies on execution-engine
//! specific details, so they are mostly implemented in the engine-specific
//! files in this directory.  This file contains material common to all
//! implementations.
//!
//! Also defined in this file is the Veracruz state machine state.  The Veracruz
//! host progresses through a particular series of states during provisioning
//! to ensure that Veracruz is secure, and also that it acts a little like a
//! function which can be partially-applied.
//!
//! Finally, the Veracruz host state is also defined in this file.  This keeps
//! track of the state of the host as material is provisioned into the Veracruz
//! enclave, and is used by the host to implement some (actually, most) of the
//! H-calls mentioned above.  In particular, the host state keeps track of:
//! - The number of expected data sources that the host is expecting,
//!   derived from the policy,
//! - The number of expected data sources already provisioned, and various
//!   bits of metadata about them (e.g. who provisioned them),
//! - The current machine state, e.g. `MachineState::ReadyToExecute`,
//! - Any result that the WASM program executing on Veracruz may have
//!   written to the host with the `__veracruz_hcall_write_output()` H-call.
//!   Note that this is stored as an uninterpreted set of bytes in the host,
//!   the host doesn't necessarily know how to interpret it: that's a detail
//!   to be agreed between the participants in the computation,
//! - Some WASM engine specific details, including a reference to the WASM
//!   module executing and the linear memory of the module.  As these types
//!   are engine-specific, we abstract over them with type-variables here.
//!
//! We also include a lot of generic material for working with the host state,
//! including functions for changing various values, and bumping the host state
//! around the state machine.
