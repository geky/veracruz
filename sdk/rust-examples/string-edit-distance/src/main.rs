//! String edit distance of two UTF-8 strings.
//!
//! ## Context
//!
//! Inputs:                  2.
//! Assumed form of inputs:  UTF-8 strings to compare.
//! Ensured form of outputs: A Pinecone-encoded `usize` which captures the
//!                          Damerau-Lehventstein edit distance between the two
//!                          strings.
